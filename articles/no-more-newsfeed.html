		<h1> No More Newsfeed</h1>
		<p> About a couple of weeks ago, I installed the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/news-feed-eradicator-for/fjcldmjmjhkklehbacihaiopjklihlgg"> News Feed Eradicator </a> on my Chrome browser. Instead, I now get a quote that is supposed to motivate me to not give in to procrastination:</p>

		<p>Obviously, I just found other ways to procrastinate: read blogs, go on Youtube, talk to people in my office more often, etc. But I've found these distractions much shorter and easier to get away from than mindlessly going through the infinite flow of information about some people I barely know anymore. Do you ever close your Facebook window, only to find yourself typing 'fa' immediately after? This *almost* doesn't happen to me anymore (it's quite scary how mindless I used to get scrolling down my newsfeed). </p>

		<br>
		<p> I used to think that getting rid of my newsfeed would make me feel disconnected from my friends and especially from what is going on in the world. While I need to make more of an effort to keep up with the news, I still have access to what people who are on my "closest friends" list are doing on Facebook. Since that list only has about 30 people in it, I spend at most 15 minutes a day going through this "mini-newsfeed". </p>

		<p> Strangely enough, I feel more engaged with this group of friends: the material I have access to is limited, so the days where it could take 30 minutes until I could get to to posts I've already read (I know you do it too!) are over. When I want to talk to someone, I do it. My presence and interactions on Facebook have become much more purposeful and active rather than passive. </p>

		<p>But what has surprised me the most is this other weird side-effect: I comment more, and more carelessly. I used to be the 'liker': I'd only comment when I felt compelled, obligated to, and liked pictures, liked comments, liked posts, liked, liked, liked the minutes away... But now, I don't have access to other people's posts and comments through the newsfeed, so I don't <em> feel  </em> watched. It doesn't seem like people will <em> actually</em> read what I write. I created my own virtual bubble within the virtual space.</p> 

		<p> And what's even more interesting is that I realized that there is a way to comment. A bit like when you see adults commenting on each other's profile pictures and think, "What are they saying? Don't they know how to behave on Facebook?" I noticed that there is a way to comment: a set of tones, syntaxes and grammars that are deemed acceptable by the users, and that maybe one day, I will become the adult who doesn't know how to behave because I've been away from the newsfeed for too long.</p>

		<p> The newsfeed eradicator might not have helped me to stop procrastinating, but I feel like it has made my procrastination more productive, if that's possible.</p>
