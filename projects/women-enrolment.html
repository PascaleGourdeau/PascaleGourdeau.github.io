		<p> Part of my mandate this semester as co-VP Diversity of the Computer Science Undergraduate Society was to make women enrolment in Computer Science for majors, minors, honours and all programs in the past 20 years available to the students.</p>
		<p> The data was kindly given to CSUS by the Department of Computer Science and the posters are up on the 3rd floor of the Trottier Building, where computer science students hang out, do homework and work on projects.</p>
		<p>The numbers are for all minor, major and honours programs within both the Faculty of Science and the Faculty of Arts, and include joint programs (for example, Mathematics and Computer Science Joint Honours).</p>
