		<p> I was born and raised in Montreal, still living in the city, one of the greatest, most exciting place to be!</p>
		<p> Before attending university, I went to <a href="http://pearsoncollege.ca/"> Lester B. Pearson UWC of the Pacific</a> for two years. a boarding school part of the <a href="http://uwc.org">United World Colleges</a> movement. The UWC mission is to make education a force to unite people, nations and cultures for peace and a sustainable future. There are no words to express how transformational this experience was. I met incredible individuals with whom I developed family-like bonds, became a better version of myself, built the foundations for a fulfilling life, discovered passions, etc.</p>
