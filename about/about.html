		<p> I am born and raised in Montreal, and still living in that wonderful city -- one of the greatest and most exciting place to be!</p>
		<p>I am now in my third year of studying Computer Science at McGill University, with a minor in Mathematics.
		In my last two years, I’ve enjoyed every course I’ve taken, loved participating in <a href="http://www.pascalegourdeau.com/projects.html">hackathons</a>, did a little bit of <a href="http://www.pascalegourdeau.com/research.html">research</a>, and the verdict has come: I can’t see myself studying anything else!</p>
		<p> Before attending university, I went to <a href="http://pearsoncollege.ca/"> Lester B. Pearson UWC of the Pacific</a> for two years, a boarding school part of the <a href="http://uwc.org">United World Colleges</a> movement. The UWC mission is to make education a force to unite people, nations and cultures for peace and a sustainable future. There are no words to express how transformational this experience was. I met incredible individuals with whom I developed family-like bonds, built the foundations for a fulfilling life, discovered passions and ultimately became a better version of myself. </p>
		<p>If you are looking for me in Montreal, you can try the McGill campus, the Plateau or kizomba socials! And if that doesn't work, shoot an <a href="mailto:pascale.gourdeau@mail.mcgill.ca">email</a>!</p>
