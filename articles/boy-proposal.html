		<h2> The Boy Proposal Algorithm</h2>
		<p> In discrete mathematics, the stable marriage problem states that given <em> m</em> men and <em>m</em>, each of which has ranked all the members of the opposite gender from 1 to <em> m</em>, a matching M is stable if and only if each man is paired (married) to a woman and that there does not exist pairs (w_i, m_i) and (w_j, m_j) such that m_i and w_j (or m_j and w_i) have higher rankings for each other than for their spouse. You can think of it as having couples over for dinner: if the matchings are stable, there shouldn't be any two people who'd rather be with each other than with their current partner. </p>
		<p> In fact, there always exists a stable matching, and there is an algorithm that will always give you a stable matching: the boy proposal algorithm.</p>
