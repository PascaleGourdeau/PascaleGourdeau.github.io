			I am in my last year of undergrad, studying Computer Science at McGill University, with a minor in Mathematics. In the last three years, I've enjoyed every course I've taken, loved participating in <a href="http://www.pascalegourdeau.com/projects.html">hackathons</a>, and did some <a href="http://www.pascalegourdeau.com/research.html">research</a>. The verdict: I can't see myself studying anything else! I currently work in the <a href="http://rl.cs.mcgill.ca/research.html">Reasoning and Learning Lab</a> at McGill University, where I have found research projects I am deeply passionate about.

		I am interested in both the theory behind machine learning and its applications. Theory is simultaneously fun, exciting and scary; one hardly knows whether they are moving in the right direction, but the feeling of completing an elegant proof is unique and unparalleled. On the other hand, applying machine learning to solve real-world problems is deeply satisfying and creates purpose in one's life.</p><p> I could not choose one or the other: I am sure only doing theory would bring be great joy, but I believe that with education and knowledge comes great responsibilities, notably to better the world around us. Not having a direct, meaningful impact on other people's lives would leave a bitter taste in my mouth. Choosing to devote my career to applications would certainly be extremely rewarding, but spending days writing code and not being to sit down at a cafe for a day, computer-less, thinking about mathematics, would most likely bring me the blues.

			Before attending university, I went to <a href="http://pearsoncollege.ca/"> Lester B. Pearson UWC of the Pacific</a> for two years, a boarding school part of the <a href="http://uwc.org">United World Colleges</a> movement, which was a truly transformational experience.
